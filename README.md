# To-Do App with CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline for a simple to-do application using modern DevOps practices.

## Architecture Overview

### Services and Their Relationships

1. **Git Repository (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)**
   - **Purpose**: Source code management and version control
   - **Role in CI/CD**: Triggers the pipeline when code is pushed
   - **Relationship**: Acts as the single source of truth for application code

2. **GitHub Actions (CI/CD Orchestrator)**
   - **Purpose**: Automates the build, test, and deployment process
   - **Role in CI/CD**: 
     - Monitors Git repository for changes
     - Runs automated tests
     - Builds Docker images
     - Deploys to AWS EC2
   - **Relationship**: Connects Git repository to AWS infrastructure

3. **Docker**
   - **Purpose**: Containerization platform
   - **Role in CI/CD**: 
     - Ensures consistent runtime environment
     - Packages application with dependencies
     - Enables easy deployment across different environments
   - **Relationship**: Bridges development and production environments

4. **AWS EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud)**
   - **Purpose**: Cloud computing service for running virtual servers
   - **Role in CI/CD**: 
     - Hosts the production application
     - Provides scalable compute resources
     - Enables easy scaling and management
   - **Relationship**: Production environment for the application

5. **AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**
   - **Purpose**: Managed Docker container registry
   - **Role in CI/CD**: 
     - Stores Docker images securely
     - Integrates with AWS services
     - Provides image versioning
   - **Relationship**: Connects Docker builds to AWS deployment

6. **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
   - **Purpose**: Manages access to AWS services
   - **Role in CI/CD**: 
     - Provides secure credentials for deployment
     - Controls permissions for different services
   - **Relationship**: Security layer for all AWS interactions

## CI/CD Pipeline Flow

```
Developer → Git Push → GitHub Actions → Build & Test → Docker Build → 
AWS ECR Push → EC2 Pull & Deploy → Application Running
```

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- All infrastructure configuration is version controlled
- Reproducible deployments across environments
- Easy rollback capabilities

### 2. **Security**
- Secrets management using GitHub Secrets
- IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- Container security scanning
- HTTPS enforcement

### 3. **Monitoring & Logging**
- Application health checks
- Structured logging
- Error tracking and alerting

### 4. **Scalability**
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Load balancing ready
- Auto-scaling group configuration

### 5. **Backup & Recovery**
- Database backup strategies
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Data retention policies

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   - AWS Account with appropriate permissions
   - GitHub repository
   - Docker installed locally
   - AWS CLI configured

2. **Setup Steps**
   - Clone this repository
   - Configure AWS credentials
   - Set up GitHub Secrets
   - Deploy infrastructure
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline

3. **Deployment**
   - Push code to trigger automatic deployment
   - Monitor deployment status
   - Verify application functionality

## Cost Optimization

- Use AWS Free Tier where possible
- Implement auto-scaling to optimize resource usage
- Monitor and optimize container resource allocation
- Use spot instances for non-critical workloads

## Security Considerations

- Regularly update dependencies
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Implement proper logging and monitoring

## Monitoring and Alerting

- Set up CloudWatch alarms
- Configure application performance monitoring
- Implement error tracking
- Set up automated notifications for critical issues
